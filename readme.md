# LaTeX Test Template
This is a package (+template) that I made for creating tests with LaTeX.

It started out as me thinking "Hey, that revision looks pretty cool! Was that made in LaTeX?", then trying to recreate one of the questions for myself. Then I got carried away with endlessly tweaking the typesetting. Then I thought it would be fun to write a package to do it all more easily. This repository is the result of that fun work!
